Compiling the Program:

    Last semester, you showed me how to use a Makefile.
    I have included one with this project, and the make tool
    will compile it by default.
        
        $  make
    
    Will generate an executable output named `sudoku`.  =)
    


Running the Program:
    
    The file with the solution, such as sudoku.in, is meant to
    be passed through a command line argument.  The syntax for
    my program is:
    
        $  sudoku file.in
        
    The path to the input file must be relative to the location
    from the directory which contains the executable or an
    absolute path. It should execute as expected by evaluating
    the solution provided within the file.
